# Voice Assistant WForm Project

The project is built on voice command, which has been hugely popular recently. Voice command is used quite frequently today in mobile operating systems, personal home assistants, and many other areas such as the banking sector. 
The application was developed in English language due to the Turkish language library insufficiency in Windows Form Application on Visual Studio. The success rate of the application depends on factors such as microphone and pronunciation level.
The actions to increase the success rate are explained in detail in the report.
In the first part of the application, the user can perform certain operations with voice commands.
In the second part of the application, the data received by using both the voice command and the keyboard by using the sqlite database are recorded in the database and displayed in the application. 
One of the main gains targeted in the report is that when voice assistants are based on a decision structure and we have a big data, an application of the desired size can be developed.
